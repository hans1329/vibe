# commit.show CLI

> Audit any vibe-coded project from your terminal — the **walk-on** lane.

The official CLI for **[commit.show](https://commit.show)**. A walk-on
drops in, gets scored, and leaves — no signup, no audition fee, no league
entry. You get the same Claude-grade analysis used in the full season
(Audit / Scout / Community breakdown, 3 strengths + 2 concerns, rank,
delta since the last snapshot). Local runs also save `.commitshow/audit.md`
so your AI coding agent can read the report in the next turn and iterate.

When a walk-on is ready to enter the season for real — Scout forecasts,
season ranking, Backstage prompt-extraction, Hall of Fame — they audition
at <https://commit.show/submit>.

The npm package + command is `commitshow` (no dot — npm doesn't allow it in
package names). Everything else uses the brand `commit.show`.

```bash
npx commitshow@latest audit
# or audit any public project by URL — no cd required
npx commitshow@latest audit github.com/owner/repo
```

## Install

```bash
# one-shot
npx commitshow@latest audit <target>

# or global
npm i -g commitshow
commitshow audit <target>
```

Node 20+.

## Usage

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `commitshow audit [target]` | Fetch + render the latest audit, write `.commitshow/audit.md` in local mode |
| `commitshow status [target]` | Same render, no re-run |
| `commitshow submit [target]` | Audition a project (coming soon · needs login) |
| `commitshow install <pack>` | Install a Library artifact (coming soon) |
| `commitshow login` | Device-flow sign-in (coming soon) |
| `commitshow whoami` | Print the linked account |

### Target forms

`audit` and `status` accept a positional target that auto-detects:

| Form | Example |
|---|---|
| cwd (omitted) | `commitshow audit` · infers from `git remote get-url origin` |
| Local path | `commitshow audit ./my-repo` |
| Remote URL | `commitshow audit github.com/owner/repo` · `commitshow audit https://github.com/owner/repo` |
| SSH remote | `commitshow audit git@github.com:owner/repo.git` (auto-converted) |
| Shorthand | `commitshow audit owner/repo` |

Remote-URL mode works from any directory, which makes one-line X posts
(`npx commitshow@latest audit <their-url>`) trivial.

## The AI-coding loop

`commitshow audit` in local mode writes to `.commitshow/audit.md` **and**
`.commitshow/audit.json` after every run. Point your coding agent at them
and it picks up exactly what the audit flagged, with no prompt engineering:

```
You are pairing on <repo>. Read .commitshow/audit.md before each turn.
Pick the top concern and propose a minimal change; I'll run
`commitshow audit` again to check the delta.
```

## For agents: `--json`

`commitshow` is built on a simple idea — **CLI + stable JSON is the universal
contract** between agent ecosystems. No SDK, no MCP server, no vendor lock.
Any agent that can shell out to a subprocess can use commit.show.

```bash
# Human
commitshow audit github.com/owner/repo

# Agent
commitshow audit github.com/owner/repo --json | jq '.concerns[].bullet'
```

### Example agent workflow

> "Check my commit.show score and fix anything under 80."

```
score=$(commitshow audit --json | jq '.score.total')
if [ "$score" -lt 80 ]; then
  commitshow audit --json | jq -r '.concerns[0].bullet'
  # → agent reads this concern, picks a fix, applies edits, re-audits
fi
```

### JSON shape (v1 schema)

Stable by contract — additive fields don't bump `schema_version`; breaking
changes do. Known keys: `project`, `score`, `standing`, `strengths`, `concerns`,
`snapshot`. See `commitshow audit --json` output for the canonical example.

### Works with

- **Claude Code**, **Cursor**, **Windsurf** — any agent with shell access
- **GitHub Actions** — gate PRs on score band or axis scores
- **n8n / Zapier** — trigger workflows when scores move
- **AutoGPT / crewAI / LangChain** — subprocess tool node
- **Your own script** — 10 lines of bash + jq is the whole integration

## What's in the report

- **Score** · total out of 100, colored by threshold (teal ≥ 75 · gold 50–74 · scarlet < 50)
- **3-axis bars** · Audit / Scout / Community
- **3 strengths + 2 concerns** · asymmetric by design — concerns don't dominate
- **Rank + projected tier** · where you stand in the current season
- **Δ** · movement since the parent snapshot

## Roadmap

- `0.1` — ✓ read-only audit · status · `--json` · target auto-detect · sidecar files
- `0.2` — device-flow login · `commitshow submit` · `--watch` mode · CI exit-code gate
- `0.3` — `commitshow install <pack>` with {{VARIABLE}} substitution
- `0.4` — MCP server variant (Cursor / Claude Desktop can call commit.show tools directly · §15-C.6)
