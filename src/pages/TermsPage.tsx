// V1 minimum-viable draft (CLAUDE.md §17 flags external counsel review
// before launch). The structure here mirrors what most US-launch SaaS
// platforms publish: eligibility, accounts, user content, conduct, audit-
// engine disclaimer, fees, IP, termination, disclaimers, liability cap,
// governing law, changes, contact.
//
// LEGAL DISCLAIMER (in-code only · NOT user-facing): this draft is not a
// substitute for counsel review. Before paid auditions go live (V1 §16.2
// P7), an attorney has to sign off on the indemnity, liability cap,
// governing-law clause, and refund mechanics.

            commit.show ("commit.show", "we", "us", or "our") operates a public
            league for AI-assisted ("vibe-coded") software projects, where
            members can submit projects, receive automated audit reports, and
            participate in seasonal evaluations. By accessing or using
            commit.show (the "Service"), you agree to these Terms of Service
            (the "Terms").

          <P>
            You must be at least <B>13 years old</B> to use the Service. If you
            are under 18, you represent that a parent or legal guardian has
            reviewed and accepts these Terms on your behalf.
          </P>
          <P>
            You may not use the Service if you are barred from doing so under
            the laws of the country in which you reside, or if you are on a
            US sanctions list.

          <P>
            You must provide accurate registration information and keep it
            current. We may suspend or terminate accounts that we reasonably
            believe to contain false, misleading, or impersonated information.

            score cards, and league rankings) solely to operate, promote, and

            relevant content from your account.

        <Section title="5 · Audit reports · provided as-is" anchor="audit">
          <P>
            commit.show audit reports are produced by automated tools
            (including third-party language models, GitHub APIs, and
            Lighthouse), combined with optional human Scout forecasts. Reports
            are <B>snapshots, not verdicts</B>. They reflect the data
            available at the time of evaluation and may change as your code,
            traffic, or third-party signals change.
          </P>
          <P>
            Audit reports are NOT professional security assessments, code
            audits, or legal compliance reviews. Do not rely on a commit.show
            audit as the sole basis for a security, compliance, or
            commercial decision.

          <P>
            Each member's first three project auditions are free. Subsequent
            auditions may carry an "audition fee", described at the point of
            submission. Refund eligibility (e.g. graduation-conditional
            refunds) is described on the relevant submission page and is
            governed by those specific terms.
          </P>
          <P>
            All fees are stated in US dollars unless noted otherwise. Payment
            is processed by third-party providers (currently Stripe). Their
            terms also apply.

          <P>
            You may close your account at any time from your profile page.
            We may suspend or terminate your access if you violate these
            Terms, if we are required to by law, or if continuing the Service
            to you becomes commercially impracticable. On termination, the
            sections of these Terms that by their nature should survive
            (ownership, disclaimers, liability, governing law) will survive.

          <P>
            These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of Delaware,
            United States, without regard to its conflict-of-laws rules. Any
            dispute will be resolved in the state or federal courts located
            in Delaware, and you consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue
            there. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the
