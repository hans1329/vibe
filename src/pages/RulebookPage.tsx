            Audit pillar measures things we can detect with code analysis:
            RLS coverage, webhook integrity, query indexes, error tracking.
            These signals correlate with production-readiness. They don't
            prove it.

          <P>
            What this score doesn't see: how clean your domain logic is,
            whether your abstractions hold up under feature load, whether
            your users actually return next week. The most important parts
